<h2>The story</h2>
<blockquote>
        Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around
        to commiserate. They said,
        <q class="villagers">We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</q>
        The farmer said, <q class="farmer"><em>Maybe</em>.</q> The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild
        horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said,
        <q class="villagers">Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</q>
        The farmer again said, <em>Maybe</em>.

        The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg.
        The neighbors then said, <q class="villagers">Oh dear, that’s too <strong class="bad">bad</strong>,”</q>
        and the farmer responded, <q class="farmer"><em>Maybe</em>.</q>
        The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he
        had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said,
    <q class="villagers">Isn’t that great! Again, he said,</q>
    <q class="farmer"><em>Maybe</em>.</q>

        The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in
        it is <strong class="good">good</strong> or <strong class="bad">bad</strong> — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune;
            or, you never know what will be the consequences of <strong class="good">good</strong> fortune.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p><strong>good</strong> and <strong class="bad">bad</strong> are just one perspective. Bananas are  <strong class="good">good</strong>for monkeys,
    but monkeys are not <strong class="good">good</strong> for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...</p>
